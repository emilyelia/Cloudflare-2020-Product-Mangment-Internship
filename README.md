# Cloudflare-2020-Product-Mangment-Internship
My submission for 2020 Cloudflare Product Management Internship

You are the Product Manager for a new initiative: Cloudflare Workers for Gaming. Video games represent an exciting new opportunity for Cloudflare Workers, our distributed computing product. This vertical has unique requirements, most of which we donâ€™t fully understand. Many of us might play video games, but few have built them.

Learn what you can about Cloudflare Workers. It might be a good idea to try out the tutorial or engineering challenge. Google, our community site, and Stack Overflow are also useful resources. Study the game development industry. Learn more about how video game developers think, what needs they have, and what problems they are trying to solve.
